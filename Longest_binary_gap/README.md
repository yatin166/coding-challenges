# Longest binary gap 

**Problem:**
Find longest sequence of zeros in a binary representation of number.

You need to find the maximum sequential zeros occurred in a binary, and all the sequential zeros should be bordered by one.
for eg. 1000001, 00010000100, 01110001.
zeros that are not bordered by one can not be categorised for longest binary gap.
